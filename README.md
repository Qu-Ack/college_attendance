Though Process

we will have a page dedicated to making a class after making a class the teacher would have an option to add students to the classthat class will also have an option to schedule a lecture and will show all the previous lectures that were occured in that class
each lecture will have it's own page that will show the attendance percentage of that lecture and the list of students present in that particular lecture


in making the adding the class form, we will have two sections,
first section will allow the teacher to enter the name , class code , number of students and all sorts of information that is required.
in the second section of the form there will be an option to add the students in that class and a button to add a student
then there will be a final button to create a class.

to schedule a lecture, 
the class page will also show the previous lectures that were held in that class.
